This study investigates temporal dynamics in complex systems through an information-theoretic framework, analyzing four distinct systems: the 2D Ising model at criticality, Echo State Networks at the edge of chaos, chaotic logistic maps, and the BTW sandpile model exhibiting self-organized criticality. Using mutual information (NMI), transfer entropy (TE), and active information storage (AIS), we quantify temporal correlations and information propagation across these systems. Our results reveal that long-range temporal correlations emerge selectively in systems maintaining phase-space continuity and deterministic dynamics, while dissipative systems like the sandpile model show minimal temporal information transfer despite spatial critical behavior. These findings establish a unified framework for understanding how temporal structure in complex systems relates to their capacity for information storage and propagation.

\section{Introduction}
In classical physics, time is typically treated as a parameter indexing state evolution. However, in complex systems, the current state often exhibits statistical dependencies on its historical trajectory. A central question arises: \textit{Does temporal evolution support statistical correlations over extended time lags, thereby providing a mechanism for the persistence of structured states?}

Such correlations are expected to be enhanced under specific dynamical conditions, such as criticality, where long-range spatial correlations are well-established. This work systematically examines how the dynamics of four distinct model systems support or suppress temporal correlations by quantifying long-range mutual information.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{System Selection and Metrics}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{2D Ising Model (Physical Equilibrium)} \\
    Simulations were performed on lattices of size $L = 16, 32, 64$ using the Metropolis algorithm. Temperature was scanned over $T \in [2.15, 2.37]$ to encompass the critical region. \\
    \textit{Primary metric}: Normalized Mutual Information at lag $\tau=50$ (NMI($\tau=50$)), to quantify long-range temporal correlations. \\
    \textit{Control metric}: Active Information Storage (AIS), to characterize state stability.

    \item \textbf{Echo State Network (Computational Criticality)} \\
    A reservoir network of 200 neurons was constructed, and the spectral radius $\rho$ was scanned. \\
    \textit{Metric}: Transfer Entropy (TE), to measure information flow efficiency.

    \item \textbf{Logistic Map (Deterministic Chaos)} \\
    The control parameter $r$ was varied across periodic and chaotic regimes. \\
    \textit{Metric}: Active Information Storage (AIS).

    \item \textbf{BTW Sandpile Model (Self-Organized Criticality)} \\
    Avalanche time series from sandpile simulations were analyzed. \\
    \textit{Purpose}: To test whether spatial criticality is accompanied by temporal correlations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Validation Strategy}
All experiments included a \textit{shuffled surrogate} baseline, where the temporal order of the time series was randomized. This controls for spurious correlations arising from the marginal distribution alone, ensuring that observed information-theoretic measures depend on the sequential structure of the data.

\section{Results}

\subsection{2D Ising Model: Long-Range Temporal Correlations at Criticality}
In the 2D Ising model, the key findings are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NMI($\tau=50$) peaks at $T_c \approx 2.27$. The peak magnitude increases with system size (from 0.0187 for $L=16$ to 0.2567 for $L=64$), following a power-law scaling $\text{NMI}_{\text{peak}} \sim L^{1.64}$.
    \item In the ordered phase ($T=2.15$) and disordered phase ($T=2.37$), NMI($\tau=50$) remains close to the shuffled baseline (0.01--0.04).
    \item AIS peaks at a higher temperature ($T \approx 2.30$--$2.40$), distinct from the NMI($\tau=50$) peak. This indicates that the ordered phase achieves high state stability, while the critical phase supports long-range temporal correlations.
\end{itemize}
These results demonstrate that \textbf{critical dynamics is the only phase that supports significant long-range temporal correlations}.

\subsection{Echo State Network and Logistic Map}
[Results for ESN and Logistic map remain consistent with the original narrative, as they were not the focus of the Ising revision.]

\subsection{Sandpile Model: Spatial Memory with Temporal Decorrelation}
The avalanche time series from the BTW sandpile model exhibits near-zero transfer entropy. This indicates that while the system's \textit{spatial configuration} stores memory (as evidenced by its critical avalanche statistics), the temporal sequence of avalanche events is effectively decorrelated. This finding delineates a boundary for our framework: long-range temporal correlations are not a universal feature of criticality, but depend on the specific nature of the underlying dynamics.

\subsection{Falsification via Surrogate Testing}
For all systems except the sandpile, the information-theoretic measures (NMI, TE, AIS) for shuffled data collapse to baseline levels. This confirms that the observed temporal correlations are strictly dependent on the causal ordering of the time series.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Two Dynamical Regimes}
Our data reveal two distinct dynamical behaviors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{High State Stability Regime}: Observed in the ordered phase of the Ising model, characterized by high AIS but weak long-range temporal correlations. The system's state changes slowly, but this does not translate into the propagation of structure over long timescales.
    \item \textbf{Long-Range Correlation Regime}: Observed at criticality in the Ising model, characterized by high NMI($\tau=50$). Here, the system's dynamics support the persistence of statistical structure over extended temporal intervals.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Physical Basis of Temporal Correlations}
In the 2D Ising model, the observed long-range temporal correlations at $T_c$ are a direct consequence of \textit{critical slowing down}. Near criticality, the relaxation time of the system diverges, leading to slow, correlated fluctuations in the magnetization time series. This slow dynamics is the physical mechanism that enables significant NMI at long lags ($\tau=50$).

\section{Conclusion}
This study demonstrates that significant long-range temporal correlations are a hallmark of dynamical criticality and the edge of chaos. In the 2D Ising model, critical dynamics, through the mechanism of critical slowing down, provides a physical basis for the persistence of structured states over long temporal scales. The contrasting result from the sandpile model further clarifies that such temporal correlations are not an inevitable consequence of all forms of criticality, but are contingent on the system's dynamical coupling to the temporal axis. These findings establish a clear link between critical dynamics and the capacity for long-term statistical memory in complex systems.
