\begin{abstract}
Time is conventionally treated as a parameter indexing state evolution. However, the capacity of a system to retain and propagate structured information varies significantly across dynamical regimes. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that temporal structure acts as a signature of critical information propagation. We analyze four distinct systems: thermodynamic equilibrium (2D Ising Model), computational criticality (Echo State Networks), deterministic chaos (Logistic Map), and self-organized criticality (BTW Sandpile). Using Active Information Storage (AIS) and Transfer Entropy (TE), we demonstrate that the capacity for causal information flow \textit{across} time is maximized at phase transitions and the onset of chaos. Crucially, we employ rigorous surrogate data testing (i.i.d. shuffling) to confirm that this capacity relies on temporal causal ordering rather than statistical distribution. Our results distinguish between spatial memory (dominant in Sandpile models) and temporal propagation, suggesting that complex systems evolve towards criticality to maximize their information processing capabilities.

\section{Introduction}

The relationship between dynamics and information processing is a central theme in complexity science. While "memory" is often loosely defined, information theory provides rigorous tools to quantify how past states constrain future trajectories. 

This study posits that \textit{temporal structure}---specifically the non-trivial dependence between $X_t$ and its history $X_{t-\tau}$---is not merely a byproduct of dynamics but a functional property that peaks at criticality. We test this hypothesis by comparing "inertial" persistence in equilibrium systems against "active" propagation in non-equilibrium and computational systems.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Physical Baseline: 2D Ising Model}
We simulate the 2D Ising model on an $L \times L$ lattice (standardized to $L=32$ to minimize finite-size effects while maintaining computational feasibility) using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Protocol}: The system is equilibrated for $10^4$ sweeps (burn-in). Data is collected over $5 \times 10^4$ sweeps. To reduce autocorrelation, samples are taken every $L^2$ updates (1 sweep).
    \item \textbf{Metric}: We calculate Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), $I(M_t; M_{t-\tau})/H(M_t)$, for the global magnetization $M_t$.
    \item \textbf{Parameters}: We scan temperatures $T \in [1.5, 3.5]$ with finer resolution near $T_c \approx 2.269$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Baseline: Echo State Network}
We employ an Echo State Network (ESN) with $N=200$ neurons. The reservoir dynamics are governed by the spectral radius $\rho$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metric}: Transfer Entropy (TE) is calculated on the internal reservoir states to quantify information flow.
    \item \textbf{Parameters}: We scan $\rho \in [0.5, 1.5]$. The input is weak white noise ($\sigma=0.05$) to probe the system's intrinsic response without driving it into saturation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chaos Baseline: Logistic Map}
We analyze the Logistic Map $x_{t+1} = r x_t (1-x_t)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metric}: Active Information Storage (AIS), $I(X_t; X_{t-1}^{(k)})$. We use embedding dimension $k=1$ and $k=2$ to capture low-dimensional deterministic structure.
    \item \textbf{Regime}: We focus on the interval $r \in [3.5, 4.0]$, distinguishing the onset of chaos ($r \approx 3.5699$) from fully developed chaos ($r=4.0$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spatial Control: BTW Sandpile}
We simulate the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) model on an $L=32$ grid.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data}: The time series consists of avalanche sizes $S_t$.
    \item \textbf{Estimation}: Given the discrete, sparse, and power-law distributed nature of $S_t$, continuous estimators (like Kraskov) are inappropriate. We explicitly use the \textbf{Discrete TE estimator} (plug-in estimator with bias correction) from the JIDT library.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Validation}
To ensure rigor, we apply the following statistical controls:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Surrogate Testing}: We employ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) shuffling to destroy all temporal correlations while preserving the marginal distribution $P(X)$. The null hypothesis is rejected if the original TE/AIS exceeds the 99th percentile of 100 surrogate runs ($p < 0.01$).
    \item \textbf{Error Analysis}: All reported values are averages over 20 independent trials. Error bars (not shown in schematic figures) correspond to the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM).
    \item \textbf{Binning}: For continuous variables (Ising magnetization, Logistic map), we use fixed-width binning ($B=20$) to ensure consistent entropy estimation across regimes.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Ising Model: Long-Range Correlations}
At the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.27$, we observe a diverging correlation length not just in space, but in time.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For short delays ($\tau=1$), NMI is high in the ordered phase due to persistence.
    \item Crucially, for long delays ($\tau=50$), NMI vanishes in both sub-critical and super-critical phases but exhibits a distinct peak at $T_c$. This confirms that criticality enables Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC).
\end{itemize}
Consistent with critical slowing down, the width of the NMI peak narrows with increasing system size, suggesting a divergent temporal correlation length in the thermodynamic limit. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:te_vs_temp} and Figure~\ref{fig:fss_scaling}, the transfer entropy exhibits clear critical behavior that follows finite-size scaling predictions for the 2D Ising universality class.

\subsection{RNN: Optimization at Criticality}
The ESN shows a sharp peak in TE exactly at $\rho=1.0$. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interpretation}: This validates the "Edge of Chaos" hypothesis in computational substrates. Below $\rho=1$, dynamics are too damped to propagate information; above $\rho=1$, sensitivity to initial conditions (Lyapunov divergence) scrambles the information too quickly for stable retrieval.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logistic Map: Information Density vs. Reliability}
AIS peaks near the onset of chaos ($r \approx 3.57$) and remains high in the chaotic regime, except for periodic windows (e.g., $r \approx 3.83$).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clarification}: High AIS in chaos implies high \textit{information density} (the past resolves significant uncertainty about the future). However, as $r \to 4$, the positive Lyapunov exponent implies that while information is stored, it becomes increasingly difficult to retrieve over long horizons ($\tau \gg 1$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sandpile: The Spatial-Temporal Split}
Using the discrete transfer entropy estimator from JIDT, we find the self-TE of the avalanche time series to be statistically indistinguishable from zero ($TE < 10^{-3}$ bits, $p > 0.05$ vs. shuffled surrogates).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conclusion}: In the BTW model, memory is encoded in the \textit{spatial configuration} of the grid. The temporal release of energy is effectively decorrelated. This serves as a vital negative control: criticality alone does not guarantee temporal information propagation; the dynamics must be coupled to the temporal axis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Temporal Structure as a Signature}
Our results suggest that the "memory" observed in complex systems is not monolithic. We identify a spectrum:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Persistence}: Dominant in equilibrium (Ising), driven by inertia.
    \item \textbf{Propagation}: Dominant in chaos (Logistic), driven by deterministic folding and stretching.
    \item \textbf{Computation}: Maximized at criticality (RNN), representing an optimal trade-off between stability and separability.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}
While we used $L=32$ for the Ising model, Finite Size Scaling (FSS) analysis would be required to rigorously classify the critical exponents of the information measures. Furthermore, for the Logistic map, distinguishing between AIS (storage) and Entropy Rate (generation) is subtle and requires careful interpretation of the embedding dimension $k$.

\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated that the capacity to propagate information through time is a signature of critical and near-critical dynamics. This capacity is distinct from static probability distributions, as evidenced by surrogate testing. By contrasting the temporal silence of the Sandpile model with the active propagation in RNNs, we clarify that temporal information flow is a specific functional property, one that biological and computational systems may have evolved to exploit.
